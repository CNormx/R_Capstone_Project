# R Capstone Project
This project focuses on a fictional high-tech company named Bellabeat that manufactures health-focused smart products. The business task is to analyze Bellabeat user behavior and engagement patterns to identify trends and areas of improvement. The ultimate goal is to use this knowledge to develop new products and services that better meet the needs and expectations of the target audience, ultimately driving growth and increasing revenue for the brand.

## File Descriptions
The Bellabeat data files below can be found in `fitabase data`. <br>
- `fitabase data/dailyActivity_merged.csv` contains all of the smart devices daily activity counts

- `fitabase data/sleepDay_merged.csv` contains data on clients daily sleep habits

Code file:
- `docs/index.Rmd` contains all the R queries for data exploration and the resulting charts 

## Interesting Findings:

It appears that people walk the farthest when they are very active. However, the consistency with which they walk is inconsistent. Moderate and light activity is more likely to have a higher trend of consistent distance on a day-to-day basis. Light activity is also the second highest form of activity recorded. It begins when people wake up and ends before they go to bed. People burn more calories the more steps they take and the farther they travel.
I think it's realistic to assume that moderate and light activity that effectively burns calories appeals to the average Fitbit user. Targeting an audience of casual gym users and exercise enthusiasts would be beneficial to the brand and would attract more users.
