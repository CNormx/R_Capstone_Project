# R Capstone Project

- `fitabase data/sleepDay_merged.csv` contains data on clients daily sleep habits

Code file:
- `docs/index.Rmd` contains all the R queries for data exploration and the resulting charts 

## Interesting Findings:

It appears people go the furthest distance while very active but the consistency at which they do so is inconsistent. moderate and light activity tends to trend at a consistent distance on a daily basis. *Light activity is also the 2nd highest form of activity recorded, which begins when people wake up and before the go to bed. The more steps and the further the distances people make the more calories get burned.
